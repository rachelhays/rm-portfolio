                <h3>Educational Details</h3>
                
                <p>I am a graduate of the University of Memphis, where I earned two degrees in English (M.A., 2008; B.A., 2006). My concentration areas were Language & Linguistics, and Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL).</p><br> 
                
                <p>In 2021--after 13 years of using HTML and CSS in my role as a college instructor--I completed formal training as a full-stack software developer with Career Foundry.</p><br>
                
                <p>In December 2021, I will have completed a graduate certificate in Instructional Design Technology (IDT) at the University of Memphis. The IDT program has two concentration options from which students can choose: 1) EdTech (K-12/higher education), or 2) Design and Development (business/industry). Since I already have extensive work experience in EdTech, I chose to expand my skillset with the Design and Development concentration.</p><br>

                <p>In 2022, I intend to begin the Ed.D. program in Educational Technology.</p>

            <div class="bio-grid-item bio-grid-4-text">

                <h2>Learning, Teaching, & Growing</h2>

                <p>I believe what makes me an effective teacher is that I'm an enthusiastic and lifelong learner. I'm interested in just about everything under the sun, so I enjoy writing content and creating instructional materials about a variety of topics, organizing curricula, designing how they're presented, and choosing accompanying technology for delivery.</p><br>

                <p>That being said, like most people, I gravitate toward some topics more than others. Aside from those in the education and technology fields I've detailed above, the disciplines I study and practice most in my personal time would mostly fall into the health and wellness sector.</p><br>

                <p>After I have learned something new, the first thing I always want to do is teach others about it. So, when I set out to learn more about the topics about which I have the greatest passion, I prepare myself to have the confidence and credentials to teach the subjects.</p><br>

                <h2>Health & Wellness</h2>
                
                <p>For the reasons aforementioned--and, most importantly, for an abundantly joyful and ever-increasing quality of life--I have also completed the formal education and training listed below, holding the required licenses and/or certifications for practice:</p><br>

                <p>~Massage Therapy/LMT program (Massage Therapy Institute)</p>
                <p>~Yoga Teacher Training Certification program, 500-hour (TKYM--The Kaivalya Yoga Method)</p>
                <p>~Usui Reiki Master certification (Natural Healer)</p><br>

                <p>To maintain licenses and certifications, and for ongoing personal growth, I have also completed continuing education courses and mini-certifications in: herbalism (Herbal Academy), alchemy (Alchemy Guild), personal training (National Academy of Sports Medicine), and life coaching (Transformation Academy). Additionally, I am a Wellness Advocate with doTerra (essential oils).</p><br>

                <h2>The Connection</h2>

                <p>Finally, I am an avid reader and researcher. This is necessary in my capacity as an educator and practitioner of multiple vocations. But it's also necessary for continued growth as a human being. Life unfolds itself to each of us a little at a time. We learn. We grow. And we do our part to pass along the knowledge and skills we've acquired to the next generation.</p><br>
                <p>Topics of focus in my reading and research for the past several years include: mind-body medicine, epigenetics, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and related topics in the field of psychophysiology. In my capacity as an educator and creator of instructional technology, one of my major goals is to write programs and produce content that fosters HPI (human performance improvement). Therefore, as I research these topics and associated issues, I am constantly brainstorming ways I can use technology to create applicable learning programs.</p><br>

                <p>As an example outcome, I designed and wrote the program <em>CycleSync</em>, an app that combines qualitative data (CBT journaling and the like) with quantitative data (sleep phase data collected from smart devices) to assist individuals challenged by circadian rhythm disorders with reducing the severity of (or entirely eliminating) their flawed rhythms.</p><br>

                <p>By the way, since my primary career focus is in education and technology, at this time, I am limiting my health and wellness practitioner roles to private consulting and/or education and software development purposes.</p>

As a learner, a teacher, a human being--this is the essential ingredient, the underlying motivation that drives forward all growth and abundance. Even total transformation. Inspiration. And, in my humble opinion, that's the meaning and purpose of life. It's my life work. It's my life love.</h3>
